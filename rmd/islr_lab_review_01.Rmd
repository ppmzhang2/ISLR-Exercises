### Before Loading Data

--

It has to be in the same directory / folder as the RMarkdown file (the *working
directory*), so R knows where to find it.

--

- check working directory

```{r}
getwd()
```

--

- change working directory

  - you can change it via RStudio: `tools` - `global options` - `general`
  
  - or, a more programmatic way:  `setwd("/path/you/prefer")`
  
---
###  Importing a data set stored as a `.csv` file

--

- `read.csv` is a command that can be used to import csv files

- how:  run the `help` command

--

```{r, eval=TRUE}
help(read.csv)
?read.csv
```

--

Check the usage on the RHS `help` tab:

```{r, eval=F}
read.csv(file,
  header = TRUE, sep = ",", quote = "\"",
  dec = ".", fill = TRUE, comment.char = "", ...
)
```

---
### Exercise

--

Load the data set `Auto.csv` by completing the code below

```{r, eval=T}
df <- read.csv("../data/Auto.csv")
```

--

If that has worked, there should now be an entry `data` in the environment
window (usually top right window of RStudio)

---
### Exercise

--

1. What is the number of rows and columns in the table?
   Answer: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

2. Direct Follow-up: How many cars are there in the data set?
  Answer: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

3. What are the names of the columns in the table?
   Answer: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 
   
4. There is one categorical (i.e. non-numerical) column in this data set.
   Which is it? Answer: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

--

- Good Practice

  - look at your loaded data set to see what it looks like
  
  - commands can help you: `summary`, `View`, `names`, `dim`
  
  - Type them in the code block to see their result (or run `help` on them to
    get additional information).

---
### Basic Data Frame handling

**Exercise:**

1.  Save the entries of the column `horsepower` in the data set `df` into a new variable called `hp`. Recall that the `<-` or the `=` operator (both are very similar) allow to assign new variables.

2.  Compute the mean horsepower in the data set. You can use the command `mean` for that (run `help(mean)` for documentation), or compute it yourself. Print the result to the console using the `print` command. Answer: The mean horsepower in the data set is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

3.  Apply the `summary` command to `hp` as well to see what it does. What do you think `Min.` and `Max.` are?

---
### Solution

```{r}
hp <- df$horsepower
print(mean(hp))
summary(hp)
```

---
### Exercise - Basic plotting

Plot again `mpg` against `horsepower`, but:

1. no lines, only markers, but use triangles instead of the "rings" above.
   *Hint: Try different numbers `n` for the plotting option* `pch=n`

2. The markers should be red

3. label the x-axis "Horsepower" and the y-axis "Miles per Gallon"

4. The limits of the x-axis of the plot should be $[0, 250]$

5. Add a straight line with intercept $50$ and slope $-0.1$ to the plot.

   - Figure out how to do that by consulting the `help` documentation for
     `abline`
     
   - Note: `abline` needs to be called *after* having called `plot`;
     change the intercept and the slope until you get something resembles the
     best affine-linear regression.

---
### Linear Regression with `R`

--

- Fuel efficiency (`mpg`) against power (`horsepower`)

--

- Our affine linear regression function will be of form

`mpg` = $\beta_0$ + $\beta_1 \cdot$ `horsepower`

---
### Linear Regression with `R` - formula

`formula` specifies the proposed form for the regression function.

-  `mpg ~ horsepower`

   - shorthand for the affine-linear model:
     `mpg` = $\beta_0$ + $\beta_1 \cdot$ `horsepower`

-  `mpg ~ horsepower + 0`

   - no interception: `mpg` = $\beta_1\cdot$ `horsepower`

-  `mpg ~ horsepower + I(horsepower^2)`:

   - `mpg` = $\beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot$ `horsepower` +
     $\beta_2 \cdot$ `horsepower` $\cdot$ `horsepower`
     
   - without `I`, operators like `+` and `*` are used to indicate interaction terms

---
### Result Interpretation

--

```{r}
fit <- lm(mpg ~ horsepower, df)
```

--

the first argument is formula, the second is dataset

--
- `lm` method

  - coefficients
  
  - residuals (i.e. the errors between the response and the training data)
  
  - standard errors for the coefficients
  
  - a handle on the regression function that you can use to predict response values for (e.g. test) data.

---
### Train vs. Validation vs. Test

- holding back $25 \%$ of the data

- judge our regression later

- randomize this procedure

--

```{r}
N_REC <- dim(df)[1]
RATIO_TEST <- 0.25
N_TEST <- round(RATIO_TEST * N_REC, 0) # 98

indices_shuffled <- sample(seq(1, N_REC), replace = FALSE)
test_indices <- indices_shuffled[1:N_TEST] # test with firt 98
train_indices <- indices_shuffled[(N_TEST + 1):N_REC] # rest for training
df_test <- df[test_indices, ]
df_train <- df[train_indices, ]
```

---
### Training


How well did you do when you fitted $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ by hand in the plotting exercise above?

**Exercise:**

Plot again `mpg` against `horsepower`, but:

-   only those in the training set

-   choose the graphical options of `plot` to your liking (maybe consult again `help(plot)` to get some ideas)

-   use `abline` to plot the fitted affine-linear model from above on top of the training data. You can use the convenient shorthands for the coefficients for intercept and slope.

---
### Solution (1)

```{r}
fit <- lm(mpg ~ horsepower, df_train)
coeffs <- coefficients(fit)
print(coeffs)
beta0 <- coeffs[1]
beta1 <- coeffs[2]
```

---
### Solution (2)

```{r}
plot(df_train$horsepower, df_train$mpg,
  pch = 2, col = "red", xlab = "Horsepower", ylab = "Miles per Gallon",
  xlim = c(0, 250)
)
abline(beta0, beta1)
```

---
### Judging Linear Regression Model - T-Test

--

t-test statistic is

$$t = \frac{\beta_1 - 0}{\mathrm{SE}_{\beta_1}}$$

--

standard error (slope, inversely proportional to the amount of data)

$$\mathrm{SE}_{\beta_1} =
\sqrt{
  \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y})^2 }
  { (n-2) \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2 }
}$$

---
### Judging Linear Regression Model - R

```{r}
summary(fit)
```

---
### Exercise

The goal of this exercise is to perform a linear regression of form

`acceleration` = $\beta_0$ + $\beta_1\cdot$ `year`

---
### Walkthrough

- Visualize: what can expect with the linear regression

- Fit the affine-linear model

- Visualize the fitted regression function jointly with the training data.

- Run `summary`

  - Is there a parameter which seems to be statistically *in*significant?

- Judging from the coefficients, answer questions:

  - "How quickly did the `acceleration` of cars (at least the ones considered in the data set) increase in a time span of 10 years on average?"

  - "what acceleration would we expect cars to have in the year 2023"

---
### Exercise

The goal of this exercise is to go back to the relationship between `horsepower` and `mpg`. Recall that we fitted a linear regression model of form

`mpg` = $\beta_0$ + $\beta_1\cdot$ `horsepower`

already, and now we will compare that to a model of form

`mpg` = $\beta_0$ + $\beta_1\cdot$ `horsepower` + $\beta_2\cdot$ `horsepower^2`

i.e. a quadratic model. We would like to see whether the quadratic or the affine-linear regression works better.

Take all your knowledge and practice from the previous exercises to fit such a model, and compare the two regression variants in terms of their training and test MSEs.

---
### Solution

```{r}
fit3 <- lm(mpg ~ horsepower + I(horsepower^2), df_train)
summary(fit3)
```

---
### Solution

```{r}
y_pred_linear <- predict(fit, df_test)
mse_linear <- mean((y_pred_linear - df_test$mpg)^2)
sprintf("Linear Model: MSE=%s, s2=%s", mse_linear, summary(fit)$adj.r.squared)
```

```{r}
y_pred_quad <- predict(fit3, df_test)
mse_quad <- mean((y_pred_quad - df_test$mpg)^2)
sprintf("Linear Model: MSE=%s, s2=%s", mse_quad, summary(fit3)$adj.r.squared)
```
